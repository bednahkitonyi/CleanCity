## 5. Features Not to Be Tested

- SMTP/email verification (not part of frontend)
- Direct backend validations (only frontend calls will be tested)
- Third-party analytics or logs
- DB-level transaction performance

---

## 6. Approach

- **Black-Box Functional Testing:** Based solely on user input/output, without code-level insight
- **Manual Testing Focus:**
  - UI validation for all visible elements and interactivity
  - Data-driven testing for different pickup requests and filters
  - Cross-role testing for permissions
- **Test Case Design Techniques:**
  - Equivalence Partitioning for valid/invalid form inputs
  - Boundary Value Analysis for date, password length, and dropdowns
  - Decision Table Testing for admin status transitions
- **Responsive Testing:**
  - Use Chrome DevTools to simulate devices
  - Test real devices: Android (Chrome), iOS (Safari), Windows/macOS

---

## 7. Entry and Exit Criteria
